## Code Review Summary

The code "meets expectations" with respect to the given specification and the use cases defined. However, there are areas for improvement, especially regarding the S.O.L.D principles, error handling, and unit testing coverage. The feedback below provides a detailed critical analysis based on the code review checklist.

### Code Review Checklist Summary

7. **Unit Testing**: ✔️ Passed with comments
8. **Additional Coding Best Practices**: ✔️ Passed with comments

### Detailed Feedback

#### Input Validation

- **Tool code validation**: Not explicitly checked. Assuming the tool inventory lookup implicitly validates the tool code. Explicit validation would be beneficial.
- **Rental day count validation**: Proper validation is in place ensuring it's 1 or more.
- **Discount percent validation**: Correctly validated to ensure it's within the 0-100 range.

#### Comprehensive Functionality and Logic

- **Due date calculation**: Correctly computed based on the rental period specified.
- **Daily charges calculation**: Correctly differentiates tool types and applies charge rates accordingly.
- **"No charge" days handling**: Complies with specified rules for weekends and holidays and tool-specific rules.

#### Rental Agreement

- **Detail inclusion**: All specified details are correctly generated and included in the agreement.
- **Accuracy**: Entries are correctly calculated and displayed.

#### Error Handling

- **User-friendly messages**: Custom exceptions with user-friendly messages for invalid inputs. However, error handling for invalid tool codes (if a tool code doesn't exist in the inventory) is not directly addressed.

#### Print Functionality

- **Correct format display**: The application outputs the rental agreement in a readable format that matches specifications.

#### Code Quality (S.O.L.I.D Principles)

- **Single Responsibility**: Classes are mostly focused on a single responsibility but `CheckoutService` performs multiple tasks that could be further decomposed.
- **Open-Closed**: The application could be enhanced to more easily incorporate additional tools or holiday logic without modifying existing code directly.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Not directly applicable as there is no evident hierarchy or inheritance in the provided classes.
- **Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion**: Not implemented. The application could benefit from abstracting service functionalities through interfaces for better decoupling and testability.

#### Unit Testing

- **Coverage**: Most scenarios are covered, including edge cases for discount range and rental day count. However, there isn't a direct test for invalid tool codes which would be beneficial.
- **Specificity of test cases**: Test cases are specific and clearly named, easy to understand their intended purpose. 
- **Usage of mock objects**: Not used, which could improve testing of `CheckoutService` by isolating dependencies.

#### Additional Coding Best Practices

- **Code comments and documentation**: Adequately commented, providing clarity on functionality. Some parts, e.g., `HolidayService`, could benefit from further comments explaining the logic.
- **Reuse of code**: Generally good, though some logic (e.g., chargeable days calculation) could potentially be streamlined.
- **Null values handling**: The code has basic checks but could be more defensive, particularly in service methods expecting non-null parameters.
- **Consistent indentation and spacing**: Code formatting is consistent, aiding readability.

### Conclusion

The application fulfills the specified requirements and behaves as expected across the defined use cases. Recommendations for improvement focus on refining the application’s architecture regarding SOLID principles, enhancing error handling for broader scenarios, and employing interface-based designs for services to improve maintainability and testability. Further refinement in unit tests to cover implicit validations and the use of mocking for dependencies can enhance the robustness of the test suite.
